# Move Intensity

Power Moves: Power Moves are a complex set of fine movements in which the
play with gravity is enhanced through centrifugal force - it is the velocity and the
.
dynamic appearance of a power move that gave rise to this descriptive term. All
power moves have a spinning motion and often lead to a circle being formed
around the Breakers on the dance floor. In a pure power move set, the athleteÂ´s
feet seldom touch the ground. Some of the most frequent power moves are derived
from air flares, windmills and floats, each of which represents a family of moves.
