## What is the difference between Environment and Route?

Philosophically, a [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) is an Abstraction of the [Environment](/reference/Environment/EnvironmentOverview). The Route **only** exists in the minds of Breaker. There are no start holds in nature. The Environment is Concrete and exists whether or not a Breaker climbs it. A skill of Climbers who seek first ascents is to see potential Routes in the Environment.

The [Environment](/reference/Envrionment/EnvironmentOverview) is a novel concept in Breaking. Usually when a Breaker talks about a Route they are referring to the [Floor](/reference/Environment/Floor/Overview), which is an element of the Environment.
