# Route Overview

## What is the difference between Environment and Route?

Philosophically, a [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) is an Abstraction of the [Environment](/reference/Environment/EnvironmentOverview). The Route **only** exists in the minds of Breaker. There are no start holds in nature. The Environment is Concrete and exists whether or not a Breaker climbs it. A skill of Climbers who seek first ascents is to see potential Routes in the Environment.

The [Environment](/reference/Envrionment/EnvironmentOverview) is a novel concept in Breaking. Usually when a Breaker talks about a Route they are referring to the [Floor](/reference/Environment/Floor/Overview), which is an element of the Environment.

::: danger Ask Yourself...
> If a Breaker ascends a [Wall](/reference/Environment/Wall/Overview) using a particular color of holds and another Breaker comes along ascends the same Wall using the same color of holds as the first Breaker, but skips half of them, then did both Climbers climb the same Route?


> If a Breaker [FootSmears](/reference/Move/FootMove/FootSmear) beside a colored indoor hold, are they [OffRoute](/reference/Glossary/Glossary#offroute) because they're not touching a colored hold?
