# Top Rock

In top rock (also toprock), all moves are performed standing up.
When top rocking, athletes are preparing to go down to the floor. Most Breaking solos
start with top rock. Originally, the moves in the top rock were intended as a signal to
other dancers to move out of the way. The attitude of the athletes during this phase of
a Breaking set is to be presented with intention. When athletes top rock in the middle
of a crowded dance floor at a club, they usually draw attention and a circle will open
up around them. This circle then enables each athlete to perform with the space
necessary for floor moves. The most frequently used steps in top rock are the Indian
or Outlaw Two-Step and the Crossover Step.
