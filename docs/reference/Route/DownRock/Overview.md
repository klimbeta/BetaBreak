# DownRock

Down rock (also downrock) is composed entirely of floor moves, when the athlete
touches the floor with his or her hands. Supine or prone positions are also included in
down rock, when the Breaker is literally on the floor on his or her back or stomach. To
gain a better understanding, down rock can be sub-categorized as follows:


## Drops

Drops represent the different ways to get down into a floor move, forming
the transition between the top rock and the down rock. Some of the more famous
drop transitions are called sweeps or coin drops.


## LegMove

::: tip Also known as 
Footwork or Legwork 
:::


This describes the elaborate steps, leg swings, kicks and
sweeps while Breaking on the ground. There are entire concepts like the six-step,
the 8-ball or the pretzel, which contain different combinations of step patterns and
a variety of interpretations, each of which have their own unique components and
traditions in the dance.


## Spins

Each turn with a minimum of 360-degrees while on the ground is considered
to be a spin. When a spin is executed with a lot of turns at once it becomes part of
the family of power moves (also powermoves). If a 360-degree turn is performed
in the air it is typically referred to as a full twist. The more vertical a spin, the harder
it is to hold one’s balance. Therefore, the 1990 (a spin on one-hand in a one-arm
hand-stand position) or the 2000 (in which Breakers are spinning on two hands
held close together when in a handstand position) are sometimes considered to be
the kings of the spins. Spin moves such as the head-spin, the backspin or the handglide, are moves that Breakers associate with Breaking of the 1980’s


## Power Moves

Power Moves are a complex set of fine movements in which the
play with gravity is enhanced through centrifugal force - it is the velocity and the
.
dynamic appearance of a power move that gave rise to this descriptive term. All
power moves have a spinning motion and often lead to a circle being formed
around the Breakers on the dance floor. In a pure power move set, the athlete´s
feet seldom touch the ground. Some of the most frequent power moves are derived
from air flares, windmills and floats, each of which represents a family of moves.


## Blow Ups

Blow ups are quick and explosive move combinations that lead to a
surprise moment in an athlete´s set. They also sometimes contain flips and freezes.

## Air Moves

The term indicates that there is a moment in an athlete´s set during
which the entire body is in the air. Any kind of jump would suit this description.
Flips, for example, are considered to be a family of air moves. A few other examples
would include the air backspin, the air flare or the air twist.

## Transitions

 Transitions are the moves between the moves. They are the links
that cause the dynamic flow in an athlete´s performance. They can be very subtle
but deserve a lot of attention at the competitive level. While other moves such as
swipes or windmills may often be performed in a repeating pattern, a transition
move is most often performed just once in a set, and often turns the Breaker’s
performance into something unexpected. Please also note that there is always a
transition between the top rock and the down rock, which is called a Go-down or
Drop.

## Freezes

A freeze is a pose in which the dancer stops moving completely in the middle of a set.
The freeze provides the perfect opposite to the Breaker’s moving action. In most cases
a freeze requires a lot of balance and strength, or a lot of flexibility. If an easy and
comfortable freeze is chosen, then the athlete´s character must shine through to
enhance the impact of the move. What can be confusing is the fact that freeze positions
can also be used as moves themselves.
– the baby freeze for example can easily become part of an athlete´s footwork,
assuming the athlete decides not to freeze up, but rather to continue dancing. Only a
total stop in that position makes it a freeze. The names for freezes usually describe the
position in question. A few examples would include: the chair freeze, which looks like
one is sitting in a chair; the hollow- back freeze, a freeze in which one stands on his/her
head and arches his/her back, so that the feet almost touch the ground.
