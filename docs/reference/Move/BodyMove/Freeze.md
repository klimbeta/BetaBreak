# Freeze

A freeze is a pose in which the dancer stops moving completely in the middle of a set.
The freeze provides the perfect opposite to the Breaker’s moving action. In most cases
a freeze requires a lot of balance and strength, or a lot of flexibility. If an easy and
comfortable freeze is chosen, then the athlete´s character must shine through to
enhance the impact of the move. What can be confusing is the fact that freeze positions
can also be used as moves themselves.


## Chair Freeze

Looks like Breaker is sitting in a chair.

## HollowBackFreeze

A freeze in which the Breaker stands on their
head and arches their back, so that the feet almost touch the ground.
