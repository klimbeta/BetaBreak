# Spins

HandPivot or FootPivot

Each turn with a minimum of 360-degrees while on the ground is considered
to be a spin. When a spin is executed with a lot of turns at once it becomes part of
the family of power moves (also powermoves). If a 360-degree turn is performed
in the air it is typically referred to as a full twist. 

::: tip
The more vertical a spin, the harder
it is to hold one’s balance.

Therefore, the 1990 (a spin on one-hand in a one-arm
hand-stand position) or the 2000 (in which Breakers are spinning on two hands
held close together when in a handstand position) are sometimes considered to be
the kings of the spins. Spin moves such as the head-spin, the backspin or the handglide, are moves that Breakers associate with Breaking of the 1980’s.
