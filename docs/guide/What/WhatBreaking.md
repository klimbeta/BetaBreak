# What is Breaking?

## Introduction to the Dance Form of Breaking

Breaking is an urban dance style which originated during the mid-1970s in the New York City
borough of the Bronx. The earliest innovators of Breaking were African American and Puerto
Rican youths. During the following ~40 years, it progressed from its Bronx roots into an
internationally recognized cultural art form, with elements of urban dance forms intertwined
with extraordinary athleticism.


## A Short History of Competitive Breaking
The art of Breaking evolved from many different dances and other activities that
influenced New York youth in the years leading up to the mid-1970s. In the early years,
Breakers would break at parties, in clubs and on the street, practicing at home and in the
hallways of buildings or in community centers. During that era, structured competitions
with judging were seldom held.


By the early 1980’s, Breaking had begun to catch the attention of the mainstream media
in the United States and the dance became increasingly popular, quickly spreading across
the United States and overseas. Breaking crews like the Zulu Kings, Rock Steady crew,
Dynamic Rockers and New York City Breakers were formed – they developed not only
the foundation of the dance, but also the more complex moves.


In 1983, the major motion picture Flashdance introduced Breaking to the public on a larger
scale. Although Flashdance was not intended to be a Breaking movie, only featuring some
short Breaking scenes, the movie still had a big impact, inspiring people throughout the
world to try it.



After Flashdance, a number of Breaking-focused movies such as Breakin’ and Beat Street
were produced. Beat Street featured one of the most famous Breaking scenes ever shown
on film, the Battle between Rock Steady Crew and the New York City Breakers. It was
filmed at the Roxy, which was a popular Lower West Side nightclub in Manhattan and the
stomping ground for the Breaking scene, where crews from each of the New York areas
would come to break and Battle one another.
By the mid-1980’s, Breaking had become a global phenomenon with overwhelming media
coverage, but by the late 1980’s, most people in the world would have declared the
Breaking “fad” as having come and gone, at least in the eyes of the public.


As the 1990’s approached, only a handful of Breakers worldwide appreciated the cultural
relevance of the art form and started to pull other dancers out of early retirement to help
activate the Breaking scene again. A lot of activities and collaborations started in the field
of dance theatre, but another important stage opened up: judged competitions.


In 1990, the international Battle of the Year (BOTY) was created. In its tradition, crews
would perform a showcase representing their countries – an international group of judges
would select the best crew performances from the showcase, then the top crews would
Battle against one another for first place. It was the first dedicated Breaking event to
establish formally judged competitions on a large scale. Today, Battle of the Year involves
qualifier events on all continents and is traditionally the largest Breaking event in the world
in terms of spectator attendance.


As the 1990’s unfolded, other international Breaking events followed, including the ProAm in Miami, and the B-Boy Summit and Freestyle Session, both in California. With the
advent of these judged competitions, renewed interest in Breaking was spawned in urban
areas and the Breakers who began competing in this generation grew up participating in
organized Battles throughout the world.


In addition to Battle of the Year and Freestyle Session, today’s major international
Breaking events include The Notorious IBE (Holland), Outbreak Europe (Slovakia), the
Red Bull BC One Championships (Global), the UK B-Boy Championships (England), The
Silverback Open (USA), BIS (China), and The Undisputed World Finals (Global), among
many others primarily in North America, Europe and Asia.


In addition to an active competitive scene with prize money events and professional tours,
such as the Undisputed World Series and the UDEF Pro Breaking Tour, Breaking is
frequently featured on TV shows and in commercials, as well as in theatre performances
or as part of contemporary dance productions. In short, Breaking has evolved into a global
cultural art form with many elements of sport, given its athletic nature. This naturally led
to the 2016 decision of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to add Breaking to the
2018 Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires and, later, to the sports program for the
Olympic Games Paris 2024.
