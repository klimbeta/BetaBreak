# What is this BetaBreak Website?

## Foreword
This Breaking Rules & Regulations Manual (BRRM) contains the primary rules, provisions and
requirements for planning, organizing and operating WDSF Breaking competitions. The
BRRM shall be the central document for all WDSF Breaking events and consequently the
Preamble and all items (A.1 to A.6) and subitems of section “A. General” of the WDSF
Competition Rules apply. (Appendix IX)

It is important to note that competition formats for Breaking do not only consist of 1vs1 and
crew competitions. The sizes of the competing sides can be compatible so that, for example,
3vs3, 4vs4 and also entire crew competitions with a varied and uneven number of crew
members are possible. The choice of the mentioned categories is not exhaustive since there
are many other popular formats that exist.

## Evolution of Content
This is the current version of the BRRM (Version 5), published as of March 2023. The World
DanceSport Federation (WDSF) reserves the right to modify this document and the rules
reflected herein.

## The BetaComp website is created using Vitepress

BetaComp uses Vitepress and Vue.js to create this website. Both are open source projects, which means that they are free to use and are not controlled by a single business. 


### Vitepress

![Vitepress](/Vitepress.png)

Vitepress has a similar role to the popular publishing tool called Wordpress.

Vitepress was chosen for BetaComp for the following reasons:

- Vitepress is an open source project.
- Like the name suggests, Vitepress is very fast at loading the website.
- Vitepress works (and looks good) on any screensize.
- Vitepress is highly customizable.


### Vue.js

![VueJS](/VueJS.jpeg)

Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a declarative and component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be they simple or complex.

Vue was chosen for BetaComp for a few reasons. 

- Vitepress itself is created with Vue.
- Vue is an open source project which is in the same league as Google's [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and Facebook's [React](https://react.dev/).
- There is a large community of VueJs users, so there is lots of support when problems inevitably arise.


## Multilingual

Once BetaBreak has enough resources, the BetaBreak website will be translated into French, German, Spanish, Japanese, and Korean to serve countries with the largest Breaker populations.
