## What does 'Beta' mean in a BetaBreak? 

BetaBreak defines Beta as a system composed of four subsystems: [Environment](/reference/Environment/EnvironmentOverview), [Move](/reference/Move/MoveOverview), [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview), and [Neuro](/reference/Neuro/NeuroOverview). Each subsystem or aspect of Beta affects the other aspects of Beta. Everything is connected.

## What is the difference between Environment and Route?

Philosophically, a [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) is an Abstraction of the [Environment](/reference/Environment/EnvironmentOverview). The Route **only** exists in the minds of Dancers. There are no start locations in nature. The Environment is Concrete and exists whether or not a Breaker dances on it. 

## A Climber's Goal Affects What Aspects of Beta they Attend to.

<!-- ![InsertImage] of BetaComp in ecosystem map relating it to the other types of Climbing -->

There are many goals in Climbing, your goal determines the part of Beta that Climbers pay attention to.

It is important to remember that every type of Climbing uses every aspect of Beta, each of the four types of Climbing just emphasize different the different aspects of Beta.

### When Completing a Particular Route is a Climber's Goal

::: tip Climbers focus on the [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) aspect of Beta

Free Climbing a Route without using any tools to advance yourself along the Route. Any Moves, even if they aren't pretty, are used to complete the Route. This is by far the most common goal of Climbing. Some Routes finish at an arbitrary location, or they could finish in the middle of a Big Wall. 

- Bouldering
- Lead Climbing
- Speed Climbing
- Dyno Competition
- Psicobloc Competition
- Buildering
- System Walls
    - Moonboard
    - Kilterboard
    - Tension board

### When Moving in a Particular Way is a Climber's Goal.

<!-- ![InsertImage] of Move Climbing -->

::: tip Climbers focus on the [Move](/reference/Move/MoveOverview) aspect of Beta. 

- Climbers focus on Moves when they are training to complete a Route.
- Climbing with a weight vest.
- High altitude Alpinism without supplemental oxygen.
    - Climbers just try to keep moving when the movement of breathing becomes a challenge and each step feels strenuous, while the same Move at sea level would be easy. 
    - Climbers usually have completed their Route before with the aid of supplemental oxygen.
- Campusboarding
- Deadhang Competition
- Grip Strength Competition
    - Squamish Boulder

### When Thinking a Particular Way is a Climber's Goal.

::: tip Climbers focus on [Neuro](/reference/Neuro/NeuroOverview) aspect of Beta. 

- Free Solo Climbing and Free Base Climbing
    - Climbers cultivate the ability to calm their minds so that they can climb without any protection in Environments where a fall will result in death or life changing injury.
    - Climbers usually Free Solo Routes that they have already completed and are well under their maximum difficulty. 
    - Completing the Route is necessary but not the ultimate goal of Free Soloing. 
    - Climbers seek the release of the neurotransitter **Adrenaline**, which occurs when Climbers are in a stressful situation. Climbers often describe the feeling of "heightened senses"

- Flow Climbing
    - A subset of Neuro Climbing is Flow Climbing.
    - Requires a SprayWall with a high density of Holds.
    - Meditative
    - Since Flow Climbing often involves Down Climbing, it is difficult to belay so an Autobelay must be used or Flow Climbing is performed low to the ground like Bouldering.
    - Flow Climbing usually has lots of Traversing, Down Climbing and Climbing in circles. 
    - Climbers grip what ever hold they happen to be in a position to use. 
    - Flow Climbing is only possible when the gym is not crowded.
